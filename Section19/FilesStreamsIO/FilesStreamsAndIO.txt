- c++ uses streams as an interface between the program and input / output devices 

- independent of the actual device --> physical or virtual 

- sequence of bytes = stream.

- input stream provides data to to the program works io devices.

- output stream receives data from the program.

----------------------------------
header files to import for streams
----------------------------------

iostream - provides definition for formatted input and output from/to streams

fstream - provides defiintion for formatted input and output from/to file streams.

iomanip - provides definitions for manipulators used to format stream I/O. 

--------------------------
commonly used stream classes
--------------------------
ios - provides basic support for formatted and unformatted I/O operations
Base class most other clases. 

ifstream - provided for high level input operations on file based streams

oftstream - provided for high level output operations on file based streams

fstream - provided for high level I/O operations on file based streams derived from ofstream/ifstream (multiple inheritance)

stringstream - Provided for high level I/O operations on memory based strings derived from istringstream and osstringstream.

----------------------------------
Global stream objects
----------------------------------

cin - standard input stream , by default 'connected' to the standard input device (keyboard) 
- an instance of istream (buffered - wont be automatic until users presses enter )

cout - standard output stream, by default 'connected' to the standard output device (console)
- an isntance of ostream (buffer ends when endl; flush stream or buffer fills)

cerr - standard error stream, by default 'connected' to the standard error device (console)
- an instance of ostream (unbuffered - input and output when needed)

clog - Standard log stream - by default 'connected' to the standard log device (console)
- instance of ostream (unbuffered)

- Global objects --> init before main execution 
- Best practice --> use cerr for error messages and clog for log messages.
